"# YouTube-Clone-UI-html-css"

A static UI clone of YouTube created using HTML and CSS. The Simple YouTube Clone is a static user interface designed to mirror the look and feel of the YouTube platform, created entirely with HTML and CSS. This project serves as a demonstration of web design principles by replicating essential components of the YouTube experience, allowing users to explore a visually familiar layout without the need for dynamic content.
